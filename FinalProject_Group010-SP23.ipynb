    "Creditability helps assist financial institutions in making decisions regarding the granting of credit. The credit standing for individuals is typically based on a multitude of factors and requires nuanced computational methods to ensure accurate predictions, especially in a turbulent market when bestowers need to seriously consider whether a person is worthy of loans. The goal of this research project is to predict creditability standing for individuals based on a variety of variables like duration of credit, account balance, occupation, and other personal financial statistics. Our workflow consists of cleaning the data and normalizing it, and then used to build supervised machine learning models like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and K-nearest neighbors and then using obtained performance and error metrics, to conclude which model is best for classifying a person's credit score."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In finances, credit scoring is a way of analyzing statistical data used in financial organizations and banks to acquire a person's creditworthiness. The score itself plays a significant role in determining the creditworthiness of a person and if they are qualified to sanction a loan from the bank. The process of credit scoring is normally automated using machine learning techniques and involves evaluating various factors related to a person's or entity's credit history and financial behavior to determine the likelihood of repaying debts and fulfilling financial obligations <a name=\"abdou\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#abdounote).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of credit scoring is to help lenders make informed decisions about extending credit to potential borrowers, allowing them to evaluate the risk associated with lending money to an individual or business. This allows them to determine the terms and conditions of the pending credit offer, including interest rates and credit limits. In common credit scoring models, the following are some of the main criteria used when calculating a score:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Payment history: This factor assesses the borrower's track record of making payments on time, including any late or missed payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Credit utilization: This measures the amount of credit a borrower is using in relation to their available credit limits. Higher credit limit may negatively impact overall credit score.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Length of credit history: The length of time the borrower has been using credit is taken into account. A longer credit history is typically viewed positively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Credit mix: This factor considers the borrower's mix of credit accounts, such as credit cards mortgages, and loans. Having a diverse credit mix may be seen as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) New credit applications: Recent applications for credit or loans may have an impact on the credit score, as multiple applications within a short period can be viewed as a sign of financial instability <a name=\"xiao\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#xiaonote).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model then assigns a numerical value to each factor and generates a score (typically via machine learning models) that ranges from a minimum to a maximum value. The most commonly used scoring system is the FICO score, developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation <a name=\"fico\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#ficonote). It ranges from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating lower credit risk. With the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank and the decline of major tech giants in what appears to be a recession, it is more important than ever to develop accurate computational models that assist financial institutions in the decision-making process at the time of a customer's financial request. Today, the credit market demands new tools and technologies that can contribute to this classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our research, we attempt to apply machine learning techniques to credit analysis, specifically in predicting a person's creditability and in doing so, evaluating which variables are most relevant in defining good and bad payers. The main question at hand here is how do we measure the risk in granting credit to individuals with greater accuracy <a name=\"pinco\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#pinconote)? Some of the secondary points to consider that will aid us in answering include determining the variables that define the individual's ability to pay, what makes an individual take credit even though they are aware they don't have the resources to pay, and how the individual's behavior as a consumer impact their own creditability."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem involves creating a machine learning model to try and predict a person's creditability by utilizing different variables. In order to create such a model to solve this problem, we need to take into account a range of relevant parameters such as income, age, occupation, and more. This problem is solvable by quantifying critical variables into playing a role in an individual's credit standing. For example, credit standing will be scored in terms of “Bad” or “Good,” which will be dependent on the critical values that factor into creditability. The problem is measurable because creditability has had a long-running background in its form of operation. After comparing the predicted credit standing to the true credit standing, we can then evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the machine learning model that we plan to implement."

    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our project focuses on credit classification, several ethical and privacy concerns must be considered. First, we must consider data privacy and security since personal financial data associated with classifying credit score is confidential and highly sensitive. If we were given personally identifiable information (which can be insecure if given in the correct combinations, i.e. birthday, SSN, and address), we would have to scrap these variables or encrypt them so they are not visible during the EDA process. However, we will not be using these variables for our application, as these variables are usually provided to a third-party financial institution to perform background checks to ensure accurate credit scoring. However, the data we collected will not contain this information; instead, it contains non-personally sensitive information such as occupation and amount in the bank account. When given in combination, it is rare that such data can be used to expose customer data. Regardless, we will be asking for consent if we were to collect this data in real life. Other than that, the data set that we will be using is completely safe and customer personal information will be invisible to us and other potential adversaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concern is the biases that may emerge from an imbalance in our data collection or biased decision-making during the data labeling process. We plan to address this concern by building models that are fair and unbiased, while actively working to identify and mitigate any unfair impacts. For instance, there are signficantly more foreign workers than non-foreign workers in out data set, so perhaps we may not consider this variable or build a fair training and test split from it. Lastly, we might face concerns regarding transparency so we plan to make sure sure that the models used for classification to be transparent and explainable. Some machine learning algorithms that we use in our work, such as deep learning models, are often considered black-box models, making it challenging to interpret their decision-making process. Credit risk assessment requires transparency and explainability, as financial institutions need to understand the reasons behind credit risk predictions to comply with regulations and provide justifications for their decisions.\n",
